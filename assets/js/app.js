// // D3 Scatterplot Assignment

// Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.


// The x-values of the circles should match the demographic census data, while the y-values should represent the risk data.
// Include state abbreviations in the circles.
// Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
// Generate this chart in the d3.html file in your assignment directory.
// Note: You'll need to use http-server to display the graphic since you're pulling data in from a source outside of your app.js file.
